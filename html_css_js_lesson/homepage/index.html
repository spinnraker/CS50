            How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain
            Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For

            Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had
            goldfish.
